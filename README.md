# Background
Pens & Printers is a national office supplies chain. Currently, they distribute office supplies from warehouses located in the East, West, South, and Central areas. All four warehouses carry the same items. The head of sales believes that in some places, this results in significant product inventory that is unsold. In order to improve inventory management following insights are required:
- Are there products that do not sell as well in some locations? 
- Are there any other patterns over time in each region that can be discovered in the data?


# Task
In this project, I have done data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualisation using Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to obtain required insights as well as prepare visualisations. A full 8 slide presentation was presented under 10 mintures to shareholders in order to solve business problems. Below are few snapshots of the presentation. Full link to the presentation will be provided after snapshots
